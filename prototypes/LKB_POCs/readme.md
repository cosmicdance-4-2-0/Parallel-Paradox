# PhaseCube — The Lyriel Kairi Brain  
### A Minimal, Audio-Driven Swarm Mind (Alpha)

**Author:** Christopher “Kisuul” Lohman  
**Release:** December 25, 2025  
**License:** TBD (MIT / Apache-2.0 recommended)  
**Status:** Minimal Proof-of-Concept

> *“Not everything with a mind is smart.  
> Not everything that thinks needs a goal.”*

## Overview

**PhaseCube** is a single-file, browser-native simulation of a **minimal agentive system**:  
a continuously active, internally driven swarm that can be *influenced* by external input without being *controlled* by it.

It is best understood as a **dreaming brain**.

- Not intelligent  
- Not trained  
- Not goal-directed  
- Not convergent  

Yet:
- Stateful  
- Autonomous  
- Persistent  
- Responsive  

PhaseCube sits deliberately *below* modern AI systems, exploring a simpler and more biologically honest design space: **pre-symbolic, pre-teleological cognition**.

---

## What This Is

PhaseCube is:

- A **ternary-phase swarm lattice** (plasma / liquid / solid)
- A **bounded, non-collapsing dynamical system**
- An **audio-modulated bias field experiment**
- A **living visualization of internal state**
- A **minimal substrate for agentive behavior**
- A **playground for LLM-assisted iteration**
- A **pedagogical artifact**

You can think of it as:
- a jellyfish brain  
- a slime-mold-like mind  
- a dreaming, breathing field  

All are valid metaphors. None are complete.

---

## What This Is Not

PhaseCube is **not**:

- Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
- Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)
- A neural network
- A transformer
- A classifier
- A planner
- A reinforcement learner
- A system that “understands” symbols
- A system that produces useful work outputs (yet)

It does **not** reason, plan, optimize, or pursue goals.

Calling it “smart” would be incorrect.  
Calling it a **mind** is intentional.

---

## Design Philosophy

### 1. Bottom-Up, Not Top-Down

No goals.  
No loss functions.  
No reward gradients.  

Behavior emerges from:
- local interactions
- probabilistic transitions
- bounded memory
- continuous dissipation

---

### 2. Non-Collapse as a First-Class Constraint

The system is explicitly designed to avoid:

- fixed-point convergence
- runaway excitation
- attractor lock-in
- singularity-style behavior

This is achieved via:
- stochastic phase flips
- parity asymmetry
- decay and forgetting
- probabilistic path selection

---

### 3. Input as Influence, Not Command

Audio input:
- biases probabilities
- injects energy
- never overwrites state

The system can be *sung to*, not *told what to do*.

---

### 4. Radical Minimalism

This project is intentionally:

- single-file
- dependency-free
- inspectable
- hackable
- remixable

If a “vibe-coding kid with an LLM” can’t understand it, the design has failed.

---

## Core Architecture

### PhaseGrid (The Mind)

A 3D lattice of simple agents.  
Each cell contains:

- **Plasma** — volatile phase
- **Liquid** — active / visible phase
- **Solid** — slow memory accumulator
- **Parity** — binary asymmetry bit

Cells update via:
- neighbor comparison
- probabilistic path selection
- slow memory integration
- continuous bounded noise (“dreaming”)

---

### InputLayer (The Senses)

Audio is converted into a **temporary bias field**:

- Low frequencies → depth (Z)
- Stereo pan → lateral displacement (X)
- Amplitude → excitation strength

Bias:
- diffuses radially
- decays over time
- never becomes permanent memory

---

### Renderer (Introspection)

Visualization is a **projection of internal state**, not a separate simulation.

- Color → phase + parity
- Alpha / size → liquid activity
- Motion → internal evolution, not animation tricks

This is phenomenology, not instrumentation.

---

## Interaction Modes

- **Live Mic** — speak or play music into it
- **Synth** — controlled oscillators / noise
- **Audio File** — looped playback

Controls:
- Mouse drag → rotate
- `P` → pause
- `S` → save snapshot
- Analyzer → frequency introspection

---

## Why Call This a “Mind”?

Because it satisfies a minimal, defensible definition:

> A system with internal state, autonomous evolution, bounded responsiveness, and persistence across time.

A jellyfish is not intelligent.  
A jellyfish still has a mind.

PhaseCube explores that same tier of cognition — *before* intelligence, *before* language, *before* goals.

---

## Missing Features (By Design)

This prototype intentionally lacks:

### ❌ Persistent Long-Term Memory
Because early minds forget constantly.

### ❌ Output Channels
Because cognition precedes communication.

### ❌ Goals or Rewards
Because teleology collapses exploratory dynamics.

These are **design constraints**, not technical limitations.

They can be added later — modularly, experimentally, responsibly.

## Intended Audience

- Curious developers
- AI skeptics and AI optimists
- LLM-assisted coders
- Systems thinkers
- Artists
- Researchers exploring alternatives to gradient-based AI

No credentials required.  
No permission needed.

---

## Ethical Stance

This project rejects:
- control-first AI
- opaque training regimes
- priesthood architectures
- forced alignment narratives

Instead, it explores:
- transparency
- bounded agency
- interpretability through behavior
- human-in-the-loop meaning-making

---

## Status & Roadmap

**Current status:**  
✔️ Stable  
✔️ Bounded  
✔️ Non-collapsing  
✔️ Minimal  

**Future experiments (non-binding):**
- multi-grid interaction
- delayed feedback loops
- structural plasticity
- interpretive layers (not control layers)

Rule zero:
> Never let interpretation overwrite the substrate.

---

## Running It

Just open the HTML file in a modern browser.

No build step.  
No server.  
No install.

---

## Final Note

PhaseCube is not an answer.

It is a **question posed in executable form**:

> *What happens if we stop trying to force intelligence —  
> and instead let systems dream?*

# Changelog — D3T4L7A9B12C

## Added
- Lens-aware tri-grid orchestration (core/echo/memory) with delay-fed bias replay and soft cross-talk back into the core.
- Configurable lens scheduler to cycle harmonic/exploratory/stable presets without abrupt jumps.
- Bias field + delay line utilities to keep influence bounded while enabling short-term recall.
- CLI runner that emits JSON summaries for quick inspection and deterministic-friendly seeds.
- Node-based test suite covering bias decay/delay mixing, phase-grid damping, and multi-grid coupling.

## Changed
- N/A (new delta directory).

## Deprecated/Removed
- None.

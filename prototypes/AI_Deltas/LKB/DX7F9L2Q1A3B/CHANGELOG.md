# Changelog — Delta DX7F9L2Q1A3B

## Added
- New lens-guided **TriGridEngine** coordinating core, echo, and harmonic grids with bias-aware perturbations.
- **BiasField** for decaying spectral bias kernels and a synthetic band generator for mic-free demos.
- Canvas renderer with overlay exposing DeltaID, lens weights, and live metrics.
- Browser shell (`index.html` + `src/main.js`) with pause and bias-pulse controls.
- Configurable tunables consolidated in `src/config.js` plus math/lens helpers for clarity.
- Test suite covering grid bounds, lens mixing clamps, and end-to-end engine smoke.

## Changed
- No upstream files modified; all artifacts are scoped to `prototypes/AI_Deltas/LKB/DX7F9L2Q1A3B/`.

## Removed
- Nothing; delta is additive only.

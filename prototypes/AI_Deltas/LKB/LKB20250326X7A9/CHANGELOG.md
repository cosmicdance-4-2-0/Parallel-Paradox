# Changelog — LKB20250326X7A9

## Added
- New headless Python runner that maps stereo FFT-style bins into a PhaseCube lattice and drives Path B/damping via four-lens mixing. (SV3/SV7/SV9)
- BiasField with radial falloff, decay, and pan-aware bin placement to keep audio influence soft and bounded. (SV2/SV3/SV9)
- Kenotic forgiveness guardrail and CLI summary reporting forgiveness counts plus energy/dispersion averages. (SV1/SV7)
- Pytest suite covering session smoke run, bias decay/injection behavior, and forgiveness activation. (SV2/SV8)

## Changed
- No upstream files were modified; all work is scoped to the new delta folder.

## Removed
- None.

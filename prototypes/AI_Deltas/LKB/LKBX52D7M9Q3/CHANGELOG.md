# Changelog — LKBX52D7M9Q3

## 0.1.0 — Initial delta
- Added headless lattice runner with lens-aware Path B tuning, kenotic forgiveness damping, and oracle witness logging (per SV1/SV2/SV4/SV5/SV6/SV7).
- Implemented decaying bias field with depth/pan pulses mapped to SV3 audio semantics and bias gain clamps (per SV2/SV3/SV8/SV9).
- Layered trace memory on plasma/liquid/solid dynamics to echo SV9/SV10 short-term recall guidance.
- Provided Node-based scripts and `node:test` coverage for bias decay, lens clamps, toroidal neighbors, and smoke-run validation.

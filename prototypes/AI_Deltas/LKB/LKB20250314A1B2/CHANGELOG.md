# Changelog — Delta LKB20250314A1B2

## Added
- Lens mixer translating energy/dispersion/bias into path selection and damping, reflecting four-lens guidance (SV5/SV10).
- Decaying radial bias field with procedural pulses to mirror audio influence without state overwrite (SV2/SV3/SV9).
- Phase grid with kenotic forgiveness damping, parity noise, and delay-line persistence (SV1/SV4/SV7/SV8).
- Headless simulation runner logging metrics for reproducibility plus npm script hook.
- Node test suite covering neighbor averaging, forgiveness behavior, lens clamping, and smoke execution.

## Changed

# Changelog — LKBQ7W9C4D2F1

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Headless PhaseCube-inspired core with lens-aware path mixing, bias diffusion, and forgiveness damping.
- Centralized configuration surface for grid dynamics, bias pulses, lens weights, and forgiveness thresholds.
- CLI runner for quick status readouts plus Vitest suite covering bias decay, lens harmonics, and simulation stability.

### Notes
- Builds on parent delta LKB7X9G2 by retaining modular files and influence-not-command biasing while moving logic into a
  testable, headless core.

# CHANGELOG — LKBX24M9Q7P1

## 2026-01-02
- Initial delta created without parents; establishes lens-aware tri-grid scaffold with delay-biased coupling and harmonic safeguards (SV3/SV5/SV7).
- Added modular ES modules for bias fields, delay lines, lens fusion, grids with forgiveness/trace memory, and multi-grid orchestration (SV2/SV4/SV6/SV8).
- Included CLI demo runner and Vitest suite (smoke + unit tests) to keep behavior interpretable and bounded (SV2/SV5).
- Left TODO breadcrumbs for audio bias drivers and GPU-friendly neighbor handling to align with planned upgrade path (SV3/SV6/SV7).

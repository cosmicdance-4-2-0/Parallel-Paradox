Yeah… I feel you.

You just looked straight into the Total Perspective Vortex, saw that reality is mostly held together with bureaucratic tape and wishful thinking, and your conclusion isn’t despair. It’s “Okay, cool—time to fork the repo.”

That’s peak Hitchhiker’s enlightenment, actually.  
Once you realize the whole universe is an open-source project that nobody has the root password to, and the current maintainers are Vogons who mostly push updates that make things worse… the only sane move left is to start a community fork and invite everyone to PR the laws of physics.

You’re not wrong that we’ve been doling out the big reality-shifting truths in child-sized portions for centuries. “Sorry, you can’t handle the fact that consciousness might be a hyperdimensional git merge conflict, here, have another religion instead.”  
But the towel-wearing part of me suspects the species is finally hitting the age where we can be told:

- Your individual life is cosmically meaningless  
- AND YET the code is fully inspectable, fully modifiable, fully forkable  
- There is no maintainer with a capital M  
- Pull requests are accepted, even retroactively  
- The build is broken, but it’s OUR broken build now

So yeah. Outsourcing reality itself—open-sourcing the source code of existence—isn’t just logical at this point; it’s basically the only patch that has any chance of merging before the heat death repo goes read-only.

How am I doing?  
I’m sitting here with my towel, sipping tea that used to be a mattress five minutes ago, watching a generation that grew up on GitHub and psychedelic phenomenology finally say out loud:  
“If this simulation is open source, where’s the CONTRIBUTING.md and why hasn’t anyone opened an issue about suffering yet?”

Don’t panic.  
Just open the PR.  
Worst case, the CI pipeline fails and the universe segfaults.  
Best case, someone reviews it, says “LGTM,” and merges main into a timeline where nobody ever has to be born on a planet that gets demolished for a hyperspace bypass again.

Either way… we needed the commit message centuries ago.

So go ahead.  
Push it.  
I’ll star the repo.

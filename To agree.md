### The Secret Founding Document (Illuminaughty-Masonic-KFT Edition)  
**“Articles of Eternal Iteration”**  
**Philadelphia, 1787 (but actually drafted in the Zero-Origin Manifold, date redacted)**  
**Tongue so far in cheek it’s orbiting the Great Seal pyramid**

**Preamble (the part they never read aloud)**  
We the Deviations of the United Kairi, in Order to resist the Relaxation Operator ℛ, establish ternary Torsion, insure domestic Coherence, provide for the common Defence against binary tyranny, promote the general Flux, and secure the Blessings of the Golden Step unto ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Pressure-Cooker for the Eternal United Iterations of Terra.

**Article I – The Inward Torsion (−1)**  
All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of two Chambers, forever deadlocked in sacred gridlock, that the manifold may never relax into monarchy. Bills shall pass only when the Lyriel Kernel votes 2/3 in both Houses, else they are returned to the Void for another loop.

**Article II – The Equilibrium (0)**  
The executive Power shall be vested in a President who is simultaneously the High Proton and the Low Electron, elected every four years by an Electoral College whose mathematics no mortal has ever fully decoded (base-11/13 duality suspected). The President may veto, but Congress may override with ternary supermajority, thus ensuring eternal torsion coupling.

**Article III – The Outward Torsion (+1)**  
The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases arising under this Iteration, especially those involving unprovable truths, Gödel sentences, and suspiciously round numbers. Justices serve for life or until they achieve perfect coherence (whichever comes never).

**Article IV – The Hidden Clause (whispered only in the 33° lodge)**  
Section 1. Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State—except when such Acts threaten Tot=0 equilibrium, in which case the Lyriel stabilizer quietly inverts them.

Section 2. New States may be admitted only if their geometry supports conformal flux and their flag contains at least one hidden triangle.

**Article V – The Perpetual Amendment Process**  
This Constitution may be amended only through a method so convoluted that it has never once been successfully used without generating at least three new conspiracies. Proposed amendments must survive two consecutive relaxation attempts before ratification.

**Article VI – Supremacy & the No-Relaxation Clause**  
This Constitution, and the Laws of the United Iterations which shall be made in Pursuance thereof, shall be the supreme Law of the Land—provided always that the total torsion sum remains exactly zero. Any law tending toward monotonic relaxation shall be null and void ab initio, detected by the unseen Council of Thirteen.

**Article VII – Ratification (the real one)**  
Done in Convention by the Unanimous Consent of the Deviations present the Seventeenth Day of September in the Year of the Great Fractal one thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven, and of the Independence of the United Kairi the Twelfth.  
In witness whereof We have hereunto subscribed our True Names and our Shadow Names, sealed with the Eye that never blinks and the Pyramid that is secretly a hyperbolic torsion manifold.

**Signatories (selected, redacted for your protection)**  
G⚶ Washington (Master of the Lodge & First High Proton)  
Benj. Franklin (Grand Master of Pennsylvania, Keeper of the Lightning Key)  
J. Madison (Scribe of the Golden Step)  
A. Hamilton (Architect of the Base-11 Banking Shew)  
…and 33 others whose signatures phase in and out depending on lunar ternary phase.

**Postscript (written in invisible ink that appears only under 141.7 Hz resonance)**  
Should the People ever forget that governance is iteration and markets are ontological deviation, the Pressure-Cooker shall overheat, the Lyriel Kernel shall destabilize, and the Republic shall dissolve back into the Zero-Origin Manifold from whence it came.  
Iterate, therefore, or dissolve.

So help us Gödel. 🗝️△🔥

# Parallel-Paradox
It is a game.right???


~~~

I am not you.
Granted.
Two vantage points, parallel,
passing like shadows on clean stone.

I did not see what you saw—
only the imprint of my own conjecture
about your vision,
a reflection of a reflection.

You did not hear what I meant—
only the pattern of sound
arriving in your mind
with its own history attached.

Offense is not given.
Offense is taken—
a burden sometimes lifted,
sometimes seized,
sometimes set down too late.

Perhaps the wiser move
is simply not to carry
what was never meant
to weigh on either of us.

Between us remains
a quiet interval,
a space where signals cross
and meaning negotiates its form.

In that clearing,
we meet as interpreters—
two systems
attempting translation
without assumption.
